Game : MARRAKECH [https://www.jeuxavolonte.asso.fr/regles/marrakech.pdf]

----------------------------------------------
In this project, the goal was to apply Monte Carlo search algorithms to the board game Marrakech.

The project was implemented in Python3 on Google colab.

Repository organization: 
* the notebook [Experiments](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/blob/main/Experiments.ipynb) contains the 3 main experiments we conducted to test Monte Carlo Tree Search strategies. 
* the script [MARRAKECH](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/blob/main/MARRAKECH.py) contains the board game modelisation. It was inspired by the work of this [repository](https://github.com/sor8sh/Marrakech/blob/main/main.py).
* the script [strategies](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/blob/main/strategies.py) contains the implementation of the 7 MCTS strategies we tested.
* the script [utils](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/blob/main/utils.py) contains different functions useful for testing the strategies.
* the folder [results](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/tree/main/results) contains the .pkl files ready to be loaded and plotted.
